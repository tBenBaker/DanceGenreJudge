This repository hosts a game/survey wherein participants must judge the genre of a series of dance clips

Participants will be asked a few questions about their experience with hip hop dance before the game begins
They will then progress through 16 clips, randomly chosen from a pool of 100

Each clip has three views of the same dancer (stick-figure) performing a sequence from one of ten genres
The genres are Breakdance, Popping, Locking, Middle Hip-Hop, LA Hip-Hop, House, Waack, Krump, Street Jazz and Ballet Jazz
These clips are drawn from the AIST database

Participants responses will be recorded and stored for analysis
We will compare how humans perform according to their experience,
And compare their performance to an AI algorithm we've designed for this task
