This repository hosts a game/survey wherein participants must judge the genre of a series of dance clips

Participants are asked a few questions about their experience with hip hop dance before the game begins.
They will then progress through 16 clips, randomly chosen from a pool of about 100

Each clip has three views of the same dance from one of ten genres; Breakdance, Popping, Locking, Middle Hip-Hop, LA Hip-Hop, House, Waack, Krump, Street Jazz or Ballet Jazz. These clips are drawn from the AIST database (see their documentation for more details) 

Participants responses will be recorded and stored for analysis
We will analyze people's results according to their experience,
and compare their performance to an AI algorithm we've designed for this task.
